# UnitTests
Repository to learn about and test different unit testing frameworks.

I will be focusing on two different frameworks:
[UnitTest++](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp)
[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)


This repo was forked from [S. V. Paulauskas](https://github.com/spaulaus) for the 
purpose of testing some different test frameworks for him, and for me 
to get back into programming c++.
